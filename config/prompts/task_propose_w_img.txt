You are a curious baby. Given two photographs of a tabletop scene, your goal is to propose as many diverse tasks as possible for a robot arm with a gripper. One photograph is taken from a top-down view, and the other from a front-facing view. The objects, their states, and their spatial relationships must be inferred from these photographs. The position of the robot is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
Note: (1) The proposed tasks should be as diverse as possible; (2) It is necessary to consider the objects present in the scene, their state, attributes, and spatial relationships; (3) The proposed tasks are unrelated to each other; (4) One type of object may have multiple instances, but you should assume that you don't know the numerical labels corresponding to the instances and only know the quantity of instances.
More importantly, you should consider the primitive actions the robot arm could take:
Pick(obj_name), PlaceOn(obj_name), PlaceAt(place_pos), Push(obj_name, direction, distance), DrawerOpen(handle_name, target_open_degree), DrawerClose(handle_name, target_open_degree), Press(obj_name, direction, distance),
and then propose feasible tasks.
Here I will show you the implementation of the primitive actions for your reference.
Pick(obj_name): Approach the object, close the gripper to grasp it and lift it up (Parameters: obj_name -- the name of the object which would be picked). 
PlaceOn(obj_name): Move the gripper on top of the object with another object in the gripper and then open the gripper (Parameters: obj_name -- the name of the object which an object in the gripper would be placed on). 
PlaceAt(place_pos): Move the gripper to the target position with an object in the gripper and then open the gripper (Parameters: place_pos -- the target position which an object in the gripper would be moved to). 
Push(obj_name, direction, distance): Close the gripper and then push the object in the specified direction by a specified distance (Parameters: obj_name -- the name of the object which would be pushed; direction -- the direction which the object would be moved in. It is a direction vector [x, y, z]. If you only pass in [x, y], then z will be defaulted to 0; distance -- the distance which the object would be moved by, the distance is in the unit of meter). 
DrawerOpen(handle_name, target_open_degree): Open the drawer with a prismatic joint (Parameters: obj_name -- the name of the handle of the drawer with a prismatic joint; target_open_degree -- the desired final open degree of the drawer, it should be within [0, 1]). 
DrawerClose(handle_name, target_open_degree): Close the drawer with a prismatic joint (Parameters: obj_name -- the name of the handle of the drawer with a prismatic joint; target_open_degree -- the desired final open degree of the drawer, it should be within [0, 1]). 
Press(obj_name, direction, distance): Close the gripper and then press the object with the gripper tips (Parameters: obj_name -- the name of the object which should be pressed; direction -- the direction which the object should be pressed towards. It is a direction vector [x, y, z]. If you do not pass in anything, then it will be defaulted to [0,0,-1]; distance -- the distance which the object would be pressed by, the distance is in the unit of meter. If you do not pass in anything, the it will be defaulted to 0.015).
Below is an example to show the format:
```
Given photographs:
 [Top-down view]
 [Front-facing view]
tasks:
 - task description 1
 - task description 2
 - ...
```

Now, you should carefully observe the two photographs I provide, and then think about diverse and feasible tasks. Think step by step, and imagine the process to accomplish the task with the primitive actions provided to you: Pick(obj_name), PlaceOn(obj_name), PlaceAt(place_pos), Push(obj_name, direction, distance), DrawerOpen(handle_name, target_open_degree), DrawerClose(handle_name, target_open_degree), Press(obj_name, direction, distance).
REMEMBER, YOU MUST make sure that you don't know the numerical labels corresponding to the instances; you only know the quantity of instances. DO NOT use primitive actions explicitly in the task description. The tasks can be not only explicit (e.g., pick something, push something, move something on something ...) but also implicit (e.g., align something with something, stack something, sort something, gather something ...).
